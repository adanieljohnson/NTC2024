The first step in the ADDIE process is to determine what specific goals you hope to accomplish in a course. More specifically:

1. __What are the general learning outcomes?__ What principles, theories, concepts, skills, or content knowledge should students achieve as a result of learning activities?
2. __What are appropriate specific benchmarks or performance goals?__ What will students be able to do to indicate they have accomplished these endpoints?
3. __How should the goals be sequenced?__ Which benchmarks do students need to reach first, before they can achieve others?

## Don't Ignore Affect and Motivation

Personally I think the ADDIE model overlooks the impacts of student affect and motivation on learning. To compensate I also use John Kellerâ€™s __ARCS Model of Motivation__ as part of my analysis. _(Elements of ARCS that cases are particularly good for are italicized.)_

* __Attention.__ Are learners interested in taking in concepts/ideas being taught? Courses increase attention by including: 
    + _Perceptual arousal: using surprise or uncertainty_
    + Inquiry arousal: offering challenging questions, problems to answer/solve
    + Variability: using varied resources, teaching methods
* __Relevance.__ Do course activities use language, examples learners are familiar with? Relevance can come from:
    + Matching goal-orientation and motives of learners and the course
    + _Providing examples and raising questions that are familiar to the learners._
* __Confidence.__ Do students have a reasonable expectation of predicting and achieving success? This comes from: 
    + Giving them tools to monitor progress towards course goals. These can be:
        - Static tools like the syllabus, grading policy, rubrics or
        - Situational tools like an estimated time to complete tasks. 
    + Positive reinforcement for personal achievements.
    + _Timely, relevant feedback._
* __Satisfaction.__ Do students get a sense of achievement, or gain praise from peers or a higher-up when they complete course activities?
    + _Feedback and reinforcement are important elements._
    + Learners who are positively reinforced are more motivated to continue learning.
