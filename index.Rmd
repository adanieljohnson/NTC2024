## Why Add Cases to Your Teaching Practice?

STEM courses serve increasing numbers of students who lack self-regulated learning skills, need additional time to process information, or are neurodiverse in other ways. Instructors must give developing learners appropriate challenges that allow and encourage them to take charge of their own learning, while ALSO keeping high-performing students engaged. 

Discussion cases are a reliable way of engaging and training students who have a wide range of skills in a single course. Cases help students engage with topics more deeply and develop richer insights. They provide opportunities for students to practice both problem-solving and self-regulated learning. They are not just for developing higher order thinking though; they can be used in content-dense courses to strengthen students’ basic content knowledge, introduce new concepts, and reinforce prior concepts through application.

Cases are not a panacea; they have benefits and drawbacks. A well-designed case requires considerable development work behind the scenes. In case-oriented courses the instructor gives up their role as expert source and becomes a thinking coach instead. They must think quickly and be ready to adapt in real time.

## What You Will Find Here

The menu at the top connects you to:

* a model for identifying case goals, designing cases, then evaluating them; 
* guidelines and supporting resources for writing your own cases; and 
* a collection of sample cases showing how different types are structured.

Several shared documents are in the reusable Markdown format; [directions for converting Markdown to other formats are available here.](markdown_conversion) Most resources can be downloaded.

## Who Am I?

I am a Teaching Professor of Biology at Wake Forest University. I wrote and published my first formal teaching case in 2005, and since written or co-written >35 cases for: non-majors general biology; majors lecture and lab courses (first years to seniors); federally mandated research ethics courses; and our graduate TA training program. I've published and reviewed cases for the National Clearinghouse for Case Studies Teaching in Science (NCCSTS).

I want to share my case experiences with others who want to start using cases, or use them more. Come back often, as I will be adding more resources.
